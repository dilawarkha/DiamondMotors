            <h3><u>OVERVIEW</u></h3>
            <p>A tipper on a semi-trailer, commonly known as a tip trailer, has been an integral part of commercial
                truck applications for years. Initially, the hydraulic aggregate technology limited the body length and
                volumetric capacity of tippers. However, advancements in hydraulic cylinder technology, including front
                and telescopic cylinders, enabled the development of larger tipper bodies on truck chassis. This
                evolution eventually led to the emergence of tip trailers.
